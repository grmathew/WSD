					<h2>Harley Davidson a Quick History</h2>
				</header>
				<div id=threecolumn>
					<h3>The Early Years and Astounding Growth</h3>
					<p>Harley Davidson presented their first motorcycle in 1903. It was a racing bike and was produced by the efforts of Bill Harley and Arthur Davidson. The very next year in 1904 the first Harley Davidson dealership opens its doors and sells a total of 3 bikes. One year later in 1905 Harley Davidson hires their first employee and wins their first race. In 1909 Harley Davidson produces their first V-twin engine it was 1000cc and produced only 7hp. Harley Davidson would continue to grow until by 1920 they were the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with models available in 67 countries.</p>
					<h3>A Time of Performance</h3>
					<p>In 1928 Harley Davidson produces their first twin cam engine which is capable of producing speeds up to 100 miles per hr on a machine that wasn't much more than a  bicycle. In 1929 Harley Davidson released their 45 cubic inch V-twin engine, this engine becomes known as the flathead and is a very important moment in Harley Davidson's history. In 1936 the 61 cubic inch Knucklehead is produced and 1 year later sets a landspeed record of 136.183 miles per hr.</p>
					<h3>The War Years and Beyond</h3>
					<p>In 1941 being only one of two American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression Harley Davidson suspends production of all civilian bikes and concentrates solely on the war effort producing 90,000 motorcycles for the military. Harley begins to flounder and their reputation suffers starting with their application to the United States Tariff Commission to impose a 40% tax on imported motorcycles. Then in 1969 Harley Davidson is bought by AMF. AMF trying to increase the bottom line has labor and quality issues. The once great motorcycle manufacturing company would be sold once again in 1981 to a group of investors which includes Willie G Davidson the son of William H Davidson president of Harley Davidson from 1942-1971.</p>
					<h3>Return to Greatness</h3>
					<p>Under new ownership the flailing motorcycle manufacturer wasted no time working their way back to being the premiere manufacturer of heavyweight motorcycles. In 1983 two significant factors would contribute to the beginning of Harley's climb back to greatness. The first would come in the form of a tariff that would hobble the competition when president Ronald Reagan imposed a 45% tax on imported motorcycles over 700cc. The second would unite Harley Davidson motorcycle owners in the form of a club. HOG the Harley Owners Group was formed, and was exclusive to Harley owners. 1984 turned out to be another milestone year with the introduction of the Evolution engine as well as the Softail suspension design. The two would combine to create the Heritage Softail. By 1990 Harley Davidson had regained its rightful place as the number one heavyweight motorcycle manufacturer in the world. Harley would venture into the sport bike world with the release of the V-Rod in 2001 and the Buell Firebolt in 2002. In 2003 Harley Davidson would celebrate it 100 year anniversary as 250,000 riders descend on Milwaukee to join in the festivities.</p>
